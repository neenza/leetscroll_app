## Overview


LeetScroll is a fun way to practice LeetCode problemsâ€”think of it like scrolling through Reels or Shorts, but for coding! Each problem pops up as a full-screen card you can flip and swipe through. All the questions are grabbed and organized using Python and BeautifulSoup. If you ever get stuck, just flip the card and chat with Gemini for instant coding help and explanations. Built with Flutter and Dart, LeetScroll makes LeetCode review way more interactive and enjoyable.
